This might be true almost regardless of choice of model class and hyperparameters.

While the end use of decompositions very often involves discarding some low-information synthetic features, in principal a transformation like PCA allows us to keep all N original dimensions, just using a different orthonormal bases.  Most of the other decompositions are similar in that we *could* retain N dimensions to match the original N features, but decide usually to select a smaller number.\n",
